Longest increasing Subsequence

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence

Example:
Input: [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]
output: 4, longest is [2, 3, 7, 101]

note: there may be more than one LIS combo, just return the longest length
should run in O(n^2) complexity
